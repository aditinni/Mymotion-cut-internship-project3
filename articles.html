            Artificial intelligence rarely gets it wrong – it’s the culture that programmed it that’s messed up, says Madhavi Venkatesan.
            
            I have become accustomed to my smart phone alerting me in the morning of the time and distance to my standard destination. But last weekend, when my routine changed, my smartphone knew that I planned to cross state lines — even before I entered a new destination address into my GPS system.
            
            A few years ago, a friend who is a consultant in Silicon Valley, noted to me that our smart technology was smarter than we understood. In fact, our pocket artificial intelligence (AI) communicates with our other electronic devices. AI shares information across Bluetooth or Wi-Fi networks. (Have you noticed how the passcodes stored on your home computer are available on your smartphone, even without synching?) He pointed that the combination of learning algorithms and around the clock thinking mean that AI is constantly gathering information which it then processes relative to its programming.
            
            On the surface this may appear benign. But, once you consider how many of our daily decisions are not conscious, AI has a tremendous opportunity to influence actions or inaction. Taking this further, given the imperfections of our society, the benefits of AI for some may continue at the persistence of marginalisation for others. AI is dependent on human programming and its learning is dependent on the quality of data. Its objectivity is fiction.</p>
            
            <p>For AI, she noted “If people treat them badly, they’re programmed to learn from what they experience,” she said. “An AI that was put on the road and programmed to be benevolent should start to be not that kind to humans, because otherwise it will be stuck in traffic forever.”</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect to promoting ethical AI will be the companies who are leading the integration of the technology. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have significant market presence and lobbying strength. Yet, the collective power of customers and investors is even greater.</p>
